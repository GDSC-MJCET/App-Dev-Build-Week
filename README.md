### **Application Development Build Week**

In this Build Week, we will be starting off with Dart and Flutter. The code written during the sessions
will be available in the repository. You can fork the repository and run it on your system to get a better
understanding of the concepts being taught. Do not hesitate to contact us if you are unable to
understand a particular snippet of the code.
